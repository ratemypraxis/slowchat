# Slowchat

## By Sim and Jo

Slowchat is a paper-based video chat system that both adds both materiality and nostalgia to the ordinary video chat. Inspired in part by Jennycam, Slowchat mimics a livestream with a low-refresh rate, sharing live image of one participant to another through a shared server. The resulting feed arrives at the receiving end through a thermal printer and is never stored in a database. This has the effect materializing the exchange and making it ephemeral at the same time.
