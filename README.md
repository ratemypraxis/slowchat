## Materials:
- Raspberry Pi w/ Raspberry Pi OS (full-version) 
- TTL Thermal Printer 
- Pi Camera Module (ribbon connection)

## Process:
1. If this is your first time working with a RPI, see the linked guide to set up your Pi with Raspberry Pi OS.
2. With the RPI powered off, attach the Pi cam module via the ribbon connector labeled camera (not display).
3. Next, with both the RPI and printer unplugged - attach the thermal printer. The ground, RX & TX pins pictured below are where you want to connect the two.
